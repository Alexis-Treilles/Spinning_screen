# Spinning Screen Project  
A unique display system leveraging retinal persistence to create dynamic visuals on a rotating LED bar.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **rotating LED screen** capable of displaying images and animations through the concept of **retinal persistence**. It combines **FPGA-based hardware** and **software processing** to achieve high-performance image rendering in real time.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members  
- **Alexis Treilles**  
- **Elena Mallet**  
- **Hugo Daunois**  
- **Guillaume Prouteau**  

## ðŸ”§ Key Features  
- **Dynamic Visuals:** Display images and animations seamlessly on a spinning LED bar.  
- **Image Processing:** Convert Cartesian images into polar coordinates for optimized rendering.  
- **FPGA Control:** Use of the PYNQ-Z2 board for precise control of LEDs and the motor.  
- **Memory Optimization:** Efficient RAM usage for storing and processing thousands of images.  
- **Motor Integration:** Smooth motor control using a brushless motor with ESC (Electronic Speed Controller).  

## ðŸ“‚ Components  
### Hardware  
- PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board
