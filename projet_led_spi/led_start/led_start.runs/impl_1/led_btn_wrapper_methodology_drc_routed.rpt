DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP led_btn_i/top_level_0/U0/pwm_gen_inst/pwm_high_time2 input pin led_btn_i/top_level_0/U0/pwm_gen_inst/pwm_high_time2/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -9.900 ns between led_btn_i/top_level_0/U0/pwm_intermediate_inst/pwm_value_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and led_btn_i/top_level_0/U0/pwm_gen_inst/pwm_high_time_reg[8]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#53 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.956 ns between led_btn_i/top_level_0/U0/pwm_intermediate_inst/pwm_value_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and led_btn_i/top_level_0/U0/pwm_gen_inst/pwm_high_time_reg[10]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on add relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on button relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay

An output delay is missing on Dout_LED relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on clk_spi relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on pwm relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_btn_i/animation_0/U0/FSM_inst/start_neopix_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_btn_i/animation_0/U0/FSM_inst/start_neopix_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
